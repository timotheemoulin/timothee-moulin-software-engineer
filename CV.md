# Timoth√©e Moulin

I'm a 26 years old software engineer with a passion for web technologies.

I'm now working at [Virtua SA](https://www.virtua.ch) where I'm involved in the development and maintenance process of various projects going from simple Wordpress websites to multi-channel CRM applications serving worldwide customers.

I'm also a proud member of Virtua's Customer Care. I'm always looking for ways to improve efficiency on recurrent tasks and looking for solutions that will give my team the best workflow for our projects.

In my spare time, I'm involved in the Instant Stock app. The software is fully written in Javascript with a NodeJS backend and an AngularJS frontend. Data are stored in a MongoDB database. Everything is hosted on a personal cloud Amazon server.
